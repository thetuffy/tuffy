Tuffy, smallz, she is running on The green grass. She’s very sweet, soft, like flying cotton. She’s always moving her tail to announce Her happiness. She crosses her legs softly on the big chair Of my living room. She has two small ears that move on some Occasions. She’s intelligent and sweet. She’s 4 years old. She’s like music in my ears.
