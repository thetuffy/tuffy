You no longer greet me, as I walk through the door. You are not there to make me smile, to make me laugh anymore. Life seems quiet without you. You were far more than a pet. You were a family member n friend, a loving soul I will never forgot.

God takes every pet that crosses the rainbow bridge in his loving arms and places each one on the lap of a caring Angel…

She came into our lives to teach us about love and loyalty..

If I could be half the person my tuffy is I would be twice the human I am….
