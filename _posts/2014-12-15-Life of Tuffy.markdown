Tuffy "Angel" (December 4, 2004 – October 15, 2014).I felt that she was the only thing on earth that will love you more than you love yourself. The one who listened when I talked. The one who cheered my lonely walk. The one who nuzzled when I cried. The one who comforted when I sigh. Who else could match my every mood? Who else would feast on scraps of food? Who else would prompt this monologue?
