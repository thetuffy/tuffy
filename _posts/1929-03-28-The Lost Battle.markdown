God saw she was getting tired, and a cure was not to be. So, He put His hand around her and whispered, Come with me. With tearful eyes I watched her suffer and slowly fade away. Although we loved her dearly, we could not make her stay.A golden heart stopped beating, playful paws were put to rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, 
He only takes the best!!!
